description: "The memory game, also known as the pair search game, is a classic card-based matching game that exercises memory and concentration. In this game, a set of cards (usually placed face down) contains pairs of images, symbols, numbers, or other graphics. The objective is to find and match all pairs by remembering the location of each card after it's been revealed."
